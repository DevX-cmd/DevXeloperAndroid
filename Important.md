- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevXeloperAndroid
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and building apps. I am a intermidate and now little bit of java. I am working on buiding a basic app. I am just a student.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app called Gallery+. It is a app that will show a user's photos and videos in a very nice and basic UI. The app will be made that the user will have so easiness to navigate through the app.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me on adevxeloper@gmail.com or tweet me at @DevXeloper. Will soon create insta.
Thanks
